# Aiken Hello World (CLI version)

In this tutorial we'll be running an end-to-end example of how to build and execute a Cardano validator (aka: smart contract) using only Aiken and the Cardano node cli.

The [TUTORIAL.ipynb](TUTORIAL.ipynb) file is a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of:

- making some changes to our Aiken code
- compiling our Aiken code into UPLC
- locking some tADA from our wallet into the script address
- un-locking that tADA back into our wallet

## Pre-requirements

- Cardano node connected to a testnet
- `cardano-cli`
- Aiken toolchain (https://aiken-lang.org)
- Jupyter notebooks

(or you can use https://demeter.run for a cloud-based development environment with all of the above already available)
